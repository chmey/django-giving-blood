# How to contribute

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:
- python3
- venv module for python
- pip


```
git clone https://github.com/chrisdpk/django-giving-blood
cd django-giving-blood
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If everything worked without errors, you can now start the django server using

```python manage.py runserver```

Note: In every new shell session you need to source `.venv/bin/activate` again.

Open the web app in your browser: http://localhost:8000
